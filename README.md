Here’s a polished and professional GitHub README template for your *Early Autism Detector* prototype:

---

# Early Autism Detector  
A prototype tool designed to assist in the early detection of autism by analyzing behavioral patterns. Built as part of the *Techathon* hackathon in under 4 hours, this project aims to showcase the potential of technology in addressing important societal challenges.  

---

## Features  
- **Behavioral Analysis**: Identifies key indicators such as:  
  - Lack of eye contact  
  - Delayed speech development  
  - Repetitive movements  
- **Data-Driven Insights**: Processes behavioral data to flag potential signs of autism.  
- **Quick and Lightweight**: A prototype focused on demonstrating feasibility and future potential.
